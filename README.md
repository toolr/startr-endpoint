startr-endpoint
===============
Google App Engine endpoint for startR.

## What is startR?

* startR allows you to quickly use starting points for projects.
* startR follows [sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com) snippet syntax ${1}, ${2}, ${3}, ... ${n}.

## Why was the endpoint developed?

Instead of typing:
    ```bash
    $ startr get <git clone url> [arguments] 
    ```

as in this example:

    $ startr get git@github.com:toolr/hw.angular.dart.startr.git coolprojectname

You can now type:

	$ startr get hw.angular.dart coolprojectname
